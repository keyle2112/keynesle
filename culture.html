As part of a 13-person cart team, I helped mobilize a modular stage element for a live wedding scene and major artist entrance, where precision, repetition, and trust determined whether the performance unfolded seamlessly for tens of thousands in the stadium and millions watching worldwide. The experience reinforced that impactful cultural moments depend on disciplined coordination, timing, and structured information flow across teams, where speed becomes the result of preparation rather than the priority. Operating under intense media scrutiny further strengthened my focus, professionalism, and commitment to confidentiality in high-stakes environments.',

Each set, spanning hip-hop, throwback pop, EDM, reggaeton, and more, sharpened my intuition for pacing, transitions, and crowd dynamics.
