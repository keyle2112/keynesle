    "In this project, we will specify and fit a linear model to a few features of the housing data to predict home prices. Then, we will analyze the error of the model and brainstorm ways to improve the model's performance. Finally, we'll think about the implications of predictive modeling within the Cook County Assessor's Office (CCAO) case study. This is especially relevant because statistical modeling is how the CCAO valuates properties. \n",

    "Given the history of racial discrimination in housing policy and property taxation in Cook County, consider the impacts of your modeling results as you work through this project, and think about what fairness might mean to property owners in Cook County.\n",

These property tax assessments are based on property values estimated using statistical models considering multiple factors, such as real estate value and construction cost.\n",

    "However, this system is not without flaws. In late 2017, a lawsuit was filed against the office of Cook County Assessor Joseph Berrios for producing \"[racially discriminatory assessments and taxes](https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-cook-county-board-assessor-berrios-met-20170718-story.html).\" The lawsuit included claims that the assessor's office undervalued high-priced homes and overvalued low-priced homes, creating a visible divide along racial lines. Wealthy homeowners, who were typically white, paid less in property taxes, whereas [working-class, non-white homeowners paid more](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-cook-county-assessor-berrios-sued-met-20171214-story.html).\n",

    "The Chicago Tribune's four-part series, \"[The Tax Divide](https://www.chicagotribune.com/investigations/ct-tax-divide-investigation-20180425-storygallery.html),\" delves into how this was uncovered. After \"compiling and analyzing more than 100 million property tax records from the years 2003 through 2015, along with thousands of pages of documents, then vetting the findings with top experts in the field,\" they discovered that \"residential assessments had been so far off the mark for so many years.\" You can read more about their investigation [here](https://apps.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/cook-county-property-tax-divide/assessments.html).\n",

    "The main problem with the earlier property tax system in Cook County was that it was regressive and racially discriminatory. The Chicago Tribune discovered that the Cook County Assessor's Office systemically overvalued low-priced homes and undervalued high-priced ones, shifting the tax burden onto working-class and non-white homeowners. These inequities arose from outdated, opaque assessment models, an appeals process favoring wealthier homeowners, and unequal data quality across neighborhoods. The result was a loss of public trust and a system that reinforced existing inequalities instead of ensuring fair taxation. "

Many predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods had less accurate or outdated property data, which caused the assessment model to make larger errors. Additionally, wealthier and predominantly white homeowners were more likely to appeal and reduce their assessments, while residents in marginalized communities had fewer resources or access to the appeals process.

    "`k`-fold cross validation (CV) allows us to more accurately evaluate our models than a single train-validation split. In `k`-fold CV, every data point is used in model training at some point. \n",

    "> Heads up: You should use `k`-fold cross validation to evaluate the different models you create in Question 5, as you will have limited submissions per day on Pensieve to assess your test RMSE. \n",

    "In this Project, we won't use `k`-fold CV to optimize for hyperparameters like we will in Lab 8, since OLS does not have any hyperparameters.\n",

    "Below, you will implement `compute_CV_error`. `compute_CV_error` should:\n",

Attempts will not carry over across days, so we recommend planning ahead to make sure you have enough time to finetune your model! \n",

On the log scale, the actual home price is 12, and the predicted price is 13. So, our log error is 1.

The autograder will have more than 4GB of memory, so you will not lose credit as long as your solution to Question 5 is within the total memory (4GB) limits of Datahub. By default, we reset the memory and clear all variables using `%reset -f`. If you want to delete specific variables, you may also use `del` in place of `%reset -f%`. For example, the following code will free up memory from data used for older models: `del training_val_data, test_data, train, validation, X_train_m1, X_valid_m1, X_train_m2, X_valid_m1`. Our staff solution can be run independently from all other questions, so we encourage you to do the same to make debugging easier.\n",

    "## Question 5d: Defining The Pipeline Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**This question is graded.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Akin to Question 4, you should encapsulate as much of your workflow into functions as possible. In the cell below, you should select better features and define your own feature engineering pipeline inside the function `feature_engine_final`. Use of `.pipe` is not required, but you are welcome to incorporate it! \n",
    "\n",
    "**You must not change the parameters inside `feature_engine_final`. Do not edit the two lines at the end of the question cell below. They are helper functions that define a linear model, fit your data, and compute RMSE. If you do, you will receive no credit for this question.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional requirements:\n",
    "- Any feature engineering techniques that involve referencing `Sale Price` or `Log Sale Price` (for example, removing outlying `Sale Price` values from the training data) should be performed under the condition `if not is_test_set:`, which is provided in the cell below.\n",
    "- All other feature engineering techniques should be applied to both the training and test sets. This means that you should perform them under the condition `else:`, provided in the cell below.\n",
    "- When `is_test_set` is `True`, your function should return only the design matrix, `X`.\n",
    "- When `is_test_set` is `False`, your function should return both the design matrix and the response variable `Y` (the `Log Sale Price` column).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "-  Some features may have missing values in the test set but not in the training/validation set. Make sure `feature_engine_final` handles missing values appropriately for each feature.\n",
    "- We have imported all feature engineering functions from Project A1 for you. You do not have access to the `feature_func.py` file with the function body and definitions, but they work as defined in Project A1. Feel free to use them as you see fit!\n",
    "- You may wish to consider removing outlying datapoints from the training set before fitting your model. You may not, however, remove any datapoints from the test set (after all, the CCAO could not simply \"refuse\" to make predictions for a particular house!)\n",
    "- As you finetune your model, you may unintentionally consume too much Datahub memory, causing your kernel to crash. See `q5a` for guidance on how to resolve this!!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you run into any errors, the [Proj. A2 Common Mistakes](https://ds100.org/debugging-guide/projA2/projA2.html) section of the [Data 100 Debugging Guide](https://ds100.org/debugging-guide) may be a helpful resource."

The overestimation plot shows the direction where low log-price bins have very high overestimation rates near 100%, and it steadily falls for high-price bins, meaning that high-price homes are often underestimated. This pattern matches Scenario C, where inexpensive properties are overvalued and expensive properties are undervalued, which is a regressive assessment pattern. "

    "A residual represents the difference between a home's true value and the value predicted by the model. For an individual homeowner, a positive residual means their property's actual sale price is higher than the predicted value, which means the model undervalued their home, and they may end up paying lower property taxes than they should. Conversely, a negative residual means the model overvalued their home, leading to higher property taxes. In this context, residuals reflect how fair or unfair assessments may be, like how systemically positive residuals in wealthier areas and negative residuals in lower-income or minority neighborhoods could indicate regressive or biased taxation patterns.

    "\n",
    "In the case of the Cook County Assessor’s Office, Chief Data Officer Rob Ross states that fair property tax rates are contingent on whether property values are assessed accurately —— that they’re valued at what they’re worth, relative to properties with similar characteristics. This implies that having a more accurate model results in fairer assessments. The goal of the property assessment process for the CCAO, then, is to be as accurate as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the use of algorithms and statistical modeling has real-world consequences, we often refer to the idea of fairness as a measurement of how socially responsible our work is. Fairness is incredibly multifaceted: Is a fair model one that minimizes loss - one that generates accurate results? Is it one that utilizes \"unbiased\" data? Or is fairness a broader goal that takes historical contexts into account?\n",
    "\n",
    "These approaches to fairness are not mutually exclusive. If we look beyond error functions and technical measures of accuracy, we'd not only consider _individual_ cases of fairness but also what fairness —— and justice —— means to marginalized communities on a broader scale. We'd ask: What does it mean when homes in predominantly Black and Hispanic communities in Cook County are consistently overvalued, resulting in proportionally higher property taxes? When the white neighborhoods in Cook County are consistently undervalued, resulting in proportionally lower property taxes? \n",
    "\n",
    "Having \"accurate\" predictions doesn't necessarily address larger historical trends and inequities, and fairness in property assessments in taxes works beyond the CCAO's valuation model. Disassociating accurate predictions from a fair system is vital to approaching justice at multiple levels. Take Evanston, IL —— a suburb in Cook County —— as an example of housing equity beyond just improving a property valuation model: their City Council members [recently approved reparations for African American residents](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-03-23/chicago-suburb-approves-government-reparations-for-black-residents).\n"

    "A model's predictions are fair when they not only minimize overall error (low RMSE) but also avoid systematic biases that disadvantage certain groups of homeowners. While RMSES measures accuracy on average, fairness asks who the errors affect beyond their impact on accuracy. A model could have a low RMSE yet still be unfair if it consistently overvalues lower-priced homes and undervalues higher-priced ones, leading to regressive tax burdens. A fair property assessment model would therefore ensure that residuals are them. In short, fairness requires both technical accuracy and equitable outcomes, ensuring that no community bears a disproportionate share of adverse effects. "

    "As discussed in Project A1, RMSE—while a widely used and powerful error metric introduced in earlier lectures—is not always the most appropriate choice when evaluating the *fairness* of a property appraisal system. In Question 7, you already encountered some of RMSE's limitations, particularly its tendency to disproportionately emphasize errors in high-priced properties due to the squaring of residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, rather than relying on RMSE, we will train and evaluate our model using another custom fairness metric. Specifically, we will examine the **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**, which measures the average error as a percentage of the true value. This allows us to better assess whether the model is making relatively fair predictions across different segments of the housing market.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code cells that follow, we’ll explore how MAPE varies across price ranges—comparing the model’s relative performance on inexpensive versus expensive housing. This helps identify whether the model systematically favors or disadvantages certain groups of properties based on their price.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You'll notice that we’re no longer using `lm.LinearRegression()`, but instead have started using `minimize`. This is because `scikit-learn` does not allow customization of the loss function in their standard linear regression model. The approach shown below provides an equivalent way to train a linear regression model using a custom error metric.\n",

    "MAPE differs from RMSE in that it measures percentage error $$( \\frac{|y - \\hat{y}|}{y})$$ instead of squared dollar error, so it normalizes mistakes by a home's values with the goal of this custom loss to compare errors fairly across price tiers. For example, a 10k dollar miss on a 100k dollar home (10%) is much worse than a 10k dollar miss on a $1M home (1%). This lens shows that cheaper homes, where we often overestimate, incur larger percentage errors, while very expensive homes, though they drive big dollar RMSE, tend to have smaller percentage errors and are often underestimated. This is preferable to RMSE for the CCAO context because property taxes are levied as a percentage of value. What matters for fairness is systematic relative over- or under-assessment, which MAPE captures without letting a few luxury properties dominate the metric. "
